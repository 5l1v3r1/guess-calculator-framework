# Guess calculator framework

The guess calculator framework was designed to help researchers evaluate the strength of password sets against offline attackers.
It uses an automated, machine-learning approach that processes a training corpus of passwords to learn a simple PCFG that can generate new passwords.
This PCFG is then queried to extract probabilities for passwords, and a lookup table is constructed that represents bundles of passwords in sorted order.
A 2 TB lookup table can correspond to over 700 trillion guesses, or more or less depending on the complexity of the learned grammar and the desired accuracy of the evaluation.

**Please note that this code was written for research purposes for a specific hardware configuration and was not designed with portability in mind.**
