# Probabilistic Password Cracker by Matt Weir circa 2009

This is a copy of the "Probabilistic Password Cracker" released by Matt Weir on the site https://sites.google.com/site/reusablesec/Home/password-cracking-tools/probablistic_cracker timestamped July 29, 2009.
It is reproduced here along with a small selection of other tools we developed: the `ListGuesses.sh` and `killpcfg.sh` scripts.
We hope that these tools will make it easy to run password strength experiments using this original code.

Please refer to [USAGE.md](/USAGE.md) for usage information.
